# Concern US GA4 Data Layer Specification

The objective of this repository is to provide a data layer specification for Google Analtyics 4 (GA4) for Concern US.

The specification takes Google's [automatically-collected](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?hl=en) events, [enhanced measurement events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9216061?hl=en&ref_topic=9756175), and [recommended events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267735?hl=en&ref_topic=9756175) (better organized in the [event reference](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events)) and builds upon them to provide a standardized and reusable set of events and parameters and the exact data layer code you should implement to send these events to GTM/GA4.
